"A-SYST" is a smart web-based student attendance application that uses AI to monitor students in real-time through cameras at entry and exit points. The application allows instructors to efficiently schedule classes and view attendance reports on their portals. The system has two main users: Instructors and Admin. It provides a platform to monitor attendance, analyze data, and generate records as needed. A-SYST aims to create a fairer, more efficient, and secure attendance-taking system that overcomes the limitations of manual and biometric methods.
