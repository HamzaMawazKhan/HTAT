# Human Tracking and Tagging

A-SYST is a smart web-based student attendance application to assist instructors in the scheduling of classes using Artificial Intelligence to monitor students in real-time using cameras mounted at the point of entry and exit. The purpose of the application is to allow the instructors to schedule and view student attendance reports on their respective portals efficiently. The system basically has two end-users, i.e., Instructors and Admin. It basically provides the end-users a platform where they can monitor and view student attendance analytics. They can generate the relevant database records and use them as per their requirement. The aim of the system is not only to cater to the end-users but to make the system of attendance taking fairer, smarter, and more efficient while ensuring integrity and making sure the system can not be cheated as it is done in manual and biometric attendance taking.
